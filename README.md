> Preview of The Treaty of Life  _It makes no difference if you're acting in your own self interest or for the greater good, nor if you want to secure a better future for your family or help whomsoever you so choose to live with the lightest footprint or an oil corporation or a nation because the is neither economic nor political. It mentions neither money nor law. The Treaty of Life is a restriction of chances for a great share of clout. It offers an austere identifying mark, which carries the weight of a necktie with the reverence of the hindu third eye. Like the crossing gesture across the chest but as subtle as a wink. A test transmission of radio or a firework, to mark noon, or best, an inventive source of green energy. A culture that thrives with less energy, a drink served with salt.  
Admirants have claimed the comfort of socks. That which unites us through a recripocal philisophy  to power work, collectively and to fulfill its goals at good aims. It has its downfalls though, the Treaty of Life will forever be unfinished and the last pages invite you to continue writing it. Conceptually it's a book that is not a book. It's a meter of interpretation, a plan written by one small collective.
	To do something with consideration for a vision you've had of a far future, to unite your worldiew with your life experience always draws a line into the future, and from that line, we have the ability to benefit others. -_- is in the interest of his village but his relationship with God is more complicated.
